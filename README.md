For this project, I created a personal portfolio website. The website features a simple, minimalist design with a modern, responsive layout that looks great on desktop and mobile devices.
The website's homepage includes a brief introduction, a list of my skills, and links to my social media profiles. The projects page displays a grid of my recent projects, each with a thumbnail image, a brief description, and a link to the live project or GitHub repository. The resume page provides a downloadable PDF of my resume, while the contact page includes a simple form for visitors to send me a message.
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the website from scratch.
Overall, my personal portfolio website project demonstrates my web development skills and provides a professional online presence for potential employers or clients to learn more about me and my work.
